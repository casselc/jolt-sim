# Perturb: design record

**Status:** DRAFT research record. No implementation is authorized by this
document. It records decisions taken in session, the evidence behind them, and
the open questions that must close before a v0 spec is written.

**Scope:** `perturb` is a fork of Jolt into a distinct language — a formal
Clojure-like whose deterministic simulation, effect discipline, and capability
safety are language features rather than an interception layer bolted on
underneath one. It is not a Jolt release, not a Jolt compatibility target, and
carries no JVM Clojure conformance obligation.

**Relationship to prior records.** `jolt/docs/research/APPLICATION-CORE-SEMANTIC-CHARTER.md`
predates the fork decision. Its §1.2 value set, §2 evaluation order, §2.4 error
model, and Appendix A normalization are written implementation-neutrally
("Clojure.next") and are inherited. Its §1.3 non-goals were written for a core
where "developers write ordinary Jolt" and nothing is a rewrite target; those
premises no longer hold, and each is re-decided below rather than assumed.

**Evidence labels** follow the charter §5 lattice: `proved | bounded-complete |
sampled | monitored | assumed | opaque | failed`. Nothing here is `proved`.

## 1. Findings

### E1 — Byte access through a deftype collection interface dominates codec cost

`monitored`, single non-isolated sample, unpinned toolchain (see Nonclaims).

Measured on the jolt-bencode nREPL benchmark frame (98 bytes, 10 strings):

| path | ns/byte |
| --- | ---: |
| `aget` on byte-array | 54 |
| arithmetic only, no access | 45 |
| `nth` on persistent vector | 81 |
| `reduce` over Window (IReduce) | 518 |
| `nth` on Window (deftype `Indexed`) | 1336 |

Decomposition of `decode-utf8` over a 22-byte string (45.5 µs):
`window-octets` 33 µs (72%), of which the bare `octet` scan is 29 µs (64%);
`String.`/`.getBytes` round-trip 1 µs (2%); remainder ~11.5 µs.

Root cause: `host/chez/collections.ss` `jolt-nth` is a `cond` chain whose
persistent-vector fast path is position 2 and whose `deftype` path is position
5, reached via `rec-coll-method` → `find-method-any-protocol`, which allocated a
fresh `hashtable-keys` vector and performed up to 2N string-keyed lookups per
call for an N-protocol type.

**Two prior hypotheses are refuted by this measurement.** Host-interop `String`
emulation was hypothesized (in session) to dominate: it is 0.2% of decode.
`jolt-bytes/docs/PERFORMANCE.md` attributes the gap to allocation of "decoded
Clojure values and parser result maps": allocation is real but minor —
`window-octets` costs only ~12% more than the bare scan it wraps.

Partial fix landed as `jolt@048582c3`: flatten and memoize per-type protocol
method resolution, guarded by `jolt-proto-epoch` and per-type-table identity.
Result: 1336 → 1009 ns/byte; full decode 493 → 368 µs (25%). Gates: unit
1054/1054, devirt 12/12, pic 22/22, protoret 4/4, infer 36/36.

The residual gap to persistent-vector `nth` is two string-keyed lookups still on
the path (the `type-registry` tag hash and the method-name hash) plus generic
invoke. Closing it requires resolving collection methods to a descriptor-local
slot at registration time, which changes the `nongenerative` `jrdesc` record
layout — **not attempted**; a deliberate stop, not a completed fix.

### E2 — Five independent hand-rolled ownership systems exist

`assumed` (source inspection, complete across the repos read).

| location | mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| `jolt-sim` | modeled-resource provenance ledger; self-described "not general taint tracking", "conservative for the whole scope (no early retirement yet)" |
| `jolt` core | `borrow-byte-array`/`release-byte-array` scoped descriptor loan |
| `jolt-bytes` | documented gap: "do not establish exclusive ownership or native-operation leases… callers retain responsibility" |
| `jolt-hako` | `proofs/prolog/ownership.pl` — exclusive `BaseOwner` + coexisting lease borrowers; canonical bug state is `owner_count(writer_result, 2)`; SMT families for borrow generation and lease release |
| `jolt-sim-planning` P4 | capability registry `cap[k] = :held \| [:consumed-by p]` with source closure — granted once, held, consumed exactly once, consumer recorded |

Each is a static property enforced dynamically or by convention, re-derived per
library. P4's is a linear capability type written out as a model.

### E3 — Every existing proof obligation is capability-tier

`assumed` (source inspection, complete across the repos read).

| source | proves | about |
| --- | --- | --- |
| jolt-bytes (Ansatz/CIC) | slice end preserved, slice contained, cursor reads | bounds geometry |
| jolt-hako (Z3) | builder growth prefix, bounds transactional commit, utf8 count capacity, preflight encode atomic | bounds, capacity, commit geometry |
| jolt-hako (Z3) | native lease completion, borrow generation, non-inheriting scratch | ownership, leases |
| jolt-hako (Prolog) | exclusive owner + lease lifecycle | ownership |
| jolt-bencode (Z3) | byte-string frame header, failure-consumes | framing/commit geometry |
| jolt-sim-planning P4 | capability held → consumed-by, source closure | linearity |

**No obligation is about application semantics.** Every one concerns bounds,
ownership, linearity, or commit geometry — the same tier E2's ownership systems
guard. This is the load-bearing finding for §2.2.

### E4 — The sans-io decoder shape is already validated

`bounded-complete` within its stated corpus (jolt-bytes/jolt-bencode oracles).

`jolt.bytes/read-window` and `jolt.bencode/decode` return a transactional
trichotomy — `:ok` with a new cursor, `:need-more` with the *exact original*
cursor, `:invalid` with reason/offset and the original cursor — with commit only
at the exact frame boundary. Backed by 132,672 assertions over 969 bounded
parents, 20,349 slices, 2,601 cursor reads, 4,845 two-read compositions, plus
Hegel state machines.

This is a pure step function: it never blocks and never performs I/O. The
protocol/codec layer therefore requires no continuations, empirically rather
than by design preference.

## 2. Decisions

### 2.1 Substrate — fork Jolt onto Chez

Keeps the reader, analyzer, IR, backend, deps, and build; keeps multi-shot
`call/cc`, the exact numeric tower, and self-hosting. OxCaml was evaluated: its
mode system (locality, uniqueness, linearity, portability, contention, yielding,
statefulness, visibility) is a static form of E2's hand-rolled systems, and its
unboxed types would address representation cost. It was not selected because
modes are a checker perturb writes over its own IR rather than a host feature it
must inherit, and because OxCaml supports no multi-shot handlers and has no
formalization of one-shot effects against its own extensions.

E1 is **not** evidence against this choice: `aget` at 54 ns/byte is adequate;
the measured gap is dispatch structure, not Chez codegen.

Required IR changes, from inspection of `jolt-core/jolt/ir.clj`:
`:local` carries a name, not binding identity — linearity checking needs
alpha-conversion or a `:binding-id`. The `:host`/`:host-static`/`:host-new`/
`:host-call` ops are untyped, un-effected escapes and should be replaced by a
single `:extern` carrying a declared effect row and signature. Note charter
rejected-alternative A1 ("annotate optimization IR: identity not durable through
passes") applies: the effect boundary's `site-id` must come from a durable
identity spine, not a pass-attached annotation.

### 2.2 Typing — two tiers

Ordinary values: static types with full inference, `Any` escape hatch. No proof
obligations, no modes; immutability makes the mode questions trivial.

Capabilities (handles, cursors, buffers, leases, continuations, mutable cells):
modes plus refinements. Axes kept: **uniqueness** (`unique`/`shared`),
**linearity** (`once`/`many`). Axis dropped: **locality** — regions are the
specific feature that makes effects unsound (cf. arXiv 2607.15876, Yarrow:
non-local control breaks stack discipline; multi-shot handlers break
exit-at-most-once). Escape safety for loans, handler scope, and task containment
follows from uniqueness plus linearity alone, so dropping regions avoids the
unsolved interaction at no cost to the properties E2 needs.

E3 is the justification for the tier split: refinements confined to capabilities
cover 100% of the existing proof surface without dependent types over ordinary
values and without giving up inference.

### 2.3 Proof — capability-tier refinements, Ansatz retained

Ansatz (`org.replikativ/ansatz`, a Lean 4 CIC kernel in Java with a Clojure
surface) currently proves a **pure model**, with an exhaustive bounded runtime
oracle bridging model to implementation — explicitly "not a compiler or an
executable extraction into Jolt". That bridge is load-bearing only because the
proof is about a separate artifact.

Capability-tier refinements collapse the bridge: if containment is a type on
`slice`, the implementation *is* the model and the oracle becomes a cross-check
rather than the connection. Session types over sans-io step functions are a
special case (protocol state), not a separate mechanism. Ansatz is retained for
obligations outside the type system.

Acceptance criterion for the checker, using artifacts it did not author: accept
the `*-corrected` models and reject `double-owner-bug.pl`,
`early-release-bug.pl`, `borrow-generation-check-omitted-buggy.smt2`,
`native-lease-early-release-buggy.smt2`; non-vacuity controls must still pass.

### 2.4 Effects — charter D4 retained, D3 deferred not foreclosed

Effects substitute a validated result or abort; no continuations at that layer.
Control (blocking, scheduling, virtual time) stays in the explicit cooperative
kernel. Protocols are step functions over both.

This is retained on its merits, not inherited: P5 §4.2 places bounded
completeness solely with `explore_states.clj` BFS, under stated preconditions
including **value-semantic state** — the precondition continuations break. E4
shows the codec layer needs no continuations anyway.

D3 (delimited control) stays open for direct-style application code, at a lower
evidence tier — the two-track wall P5 already draws between bounded-complete
model exploration and heuristic runtime search is the right boundary. To keep it
cheap to add, the `perform` boundary must remain a real call site with durable
identity rather than being inlined at analysis time.

### 2.5 v0 — port a measured slice, don't build a new one

Ordered:

1. **Re-measure at a pinned target tuple.** Re-run the profiles under
   `jolt-toolchains/setup-chez` at the recipe's Chez commit and jolt-bencode's
   pinned `89fe46e8`, to promote E1 from indication to evidence.
2. **Close the residual dispatch gap** (descriptor-local method slots), or
   establish that byte views must be primitive rather than user `deftype`.
3. **Mode checker against E3's existing controls.**
4. **`unique` Cursor, mutated in place** — satisfy jolt-bytes and jolt-bencode
   oracle corpora byte-identically, pass both Hegel suites, state an explicit
   target against `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`.
5. **Session type over the decode trichotomy**, then nREPL.

Steps 1–2 must precede 3–4: with dispatch dominant, the mode system's
performance case is untestable, and on current evidence modes address at most
the ~20–30% of decode that is allocation.

Gate architecture follows `jolt-toolchains`: producer records its own claims;
an independent clean-consumer job revalidates after fresh extraction; the
verifier's limits are stated rather than implied.

---

## 3. Nonclaims

1. E1's absolute numbers are not evidence at any pinned target tuple. They were
   taken on a self-built Chez 10.4.1 (unpinned against
   `jolt-toolchains/config/toolchains.json`) and jolt at `380e59e`, not
   jolt-bencode's pinned `89fe46e8`; single sample per measurement; measured
   full decode 368–493 µs against a recorded 991 µs. Ratios are structural and
   source-corroborated; absolutes are not.
2. `jolt@048582c3` is not claimed to fix E1. It is a 25% partial; the structural
   fix is identified and deliberately not attempted.
3. Modes are **not** claimed to address the measured gap. On current evidence
   they address allocation, which is the minority term.
4. The jolt-bytes suite does not validate `048582c3`: it fails identically with
   and without the patch on this jolt commit (version mismatch, pre-existing).
   Neutrality is established; validation is not.
5. No completeness, partial-order-reduction, or Molly/LDFI claim is made or
   extended. P5 §4.2/§4.3 govern.
6. E2/E3 are source-inspection surveys over the repositories read
   (jolt, jolt-sim, jolt-sim-planning, jolt-bytes, jolt-hako, jolt-bencode,
   jolt-toolchains). `jolt-toolchain` (singular) was not readable.
7. The fork is a declared remint event. Portable artifacts survive — SMT
   families, the Prolog model, Ansatz proof closures, oracle decision tables,
   Hegel property designs. Artifacts pinned to a Jolt image do not: runtime
   gates, `verify-runtime-jolt`, evidence records naming Jolt commits, and the
   jolt-sim controller ABI work. This must be declared, never silently
   reinterpreted (charter F4).

## 4. Open questions

### Q1 — residual dispatch gap: likely no layout change (was: may require remint)

`jrdesc` is `(fields tag fkeys index (mutable ptable))`,
`(nongenerative chez-jrdesc-v3)`. A descriptor-local eq-keyed method cache
therefore **already exists**, with invalidation already wired: `ptable` is `#f`
until the first `register-protocol-method`, and a stale pre-redef descriptor has
it reset to `#f` so lookups fall back to the string registry. It is keyed by
`intern-pm-key proto method`.

The collection fallback cannot use it only because `rec-coll-method` knows the
method name but not the supplying protocol. Two resolutions:

- (a) add a method-name-keyed table → `chez-jrdesc-v4`, a remint;
- (b) store the any-protocol resolution in the **existing** ptable under a
  reserved pseudo-protocol key (`intern-pm-key` with a sentinel proto name that
  cannot collide) → no field added, no version bump.

Under (b) the path is `jrec-desc` (immutable field read) → `jrdesc-ptable`
(field read) → one eq-hashtable lookup on a **module-level precomputed interned
key**. No string hashing remains.

Open sub-questions: `intern-pm-key` must not hash per call, which is why keys
for the collection methods (`nth`, `count`, `assoc`, `cons`, `seq`) are minted
once at module scope; and host tags (`"String"`, `"Object"`) have no desc, so
the string-registry fallback must remain for them.

**Status:** downgraded from blocking. Attempted in 2.5 step 2.

### Q2 — refinements over HM: not a gradual-typing boundary (framing corrected)

The original framing was wrong. Gradual typing's difficulties arise from mixing
typed and untyped code; here everything is statically typed and an unrefined
value is refined by `true` — a lattice with a top element, not a boundary.

The established mechanism is **liquid types**: HM inference plus refinements
inferred by predicate abstraction over a fixed qualifier set. Two properties
make the fit unusually close: liquid typing requires a decidable logic, normally
QF-LIA with uninterpreted functions, and every refinement in E3 is already
written in exactly that fragment in the existing `.smt2` models; and Z3 is
already a toolchain dependency via `bin/verify-models`.

The real difficulty is different: **content refinements over mutable state are
unsound under aliasing**, and `Window` is precisely an immutable descriptor over
mutable aliased storage. Uniqueness resolves this rather than complicating it —
permit content refinements only on `unique` capabilities, so no alias can
invalidate them. This is a synergy between the two axes, and independent
corroboration of the §2.2 tier split.

Remaining risks: the `Any` escape hatch requires runtime checks where refined
meets unrefined; inference for higher-order and polymorphic-recursive code is
where liquid typing is least comfortable in practice.

### Q3 — `unique` × multi-shot: under-specified, and not currently load-bearing

The stated rule ("a `many` continuation may not capture `unique` resources in
its frames") is wrong at two levels.

**Granularity.** A continuation captures the stack to its prompt, and a `unique`
value *reachable from* a captured frame — via a collection, closure environment,
or record field — is duplicated on second resume exactly as one held directly.
The property is reachability over the captured region, not frame membership, and
must stay sound through closures and calls into unknown code.

**Formulation.** This is the linearity-versus-control tension. Known-good shapes
are linear continuations (Filinski), which reduce to one-shot, or a
region/effect discipline preventing linear values crossing the prompt (Yarrow,
for regions). The formulation to try instead: **place the obligation on the
prompt, not the capture** — a `many` prompt requires its delimited body to be
`unique`-free. Checkable where the prompt is written, expressible as an
effect-row obligation, and composable with the rest of the checker.

**Satisfiability in the intended use:** search continuations range over the
kernel world, which P4 requires to be value-semantic and therefore free of
unique capabilities, so backtracking search sits inside the rule. Rejected is
application code holding a unique handle across a `choose` point — arguably
correct, since resuming twice would duplicate the handle, but it needs checking
against real scenarios: if it rejects too much, direct-style D3 code is unusable
exactly where it is wanted.

**Status:** not blocking. §2.4 defers D3; Q3 becomes load-bearing only if D3 is
taken up.

### Q4 — macro provenance: mechanism specified, reconstruction deferred

Charter Appendix A.6 defines **expansion parent (single-step)**: each NF node
records the immediate expansion step that introduced it — the role path of the
macro call site in the pre-expansion form, or `nil` for a source-written node
(realization: `V17/jolt-core/jolt/analyzer.clj:961-973`,
`V17/host/chez/host-contract.ss:236-253`). But the full expansion-parent chain
is "reconstructible by following links and is **not** part of v1 (F1)."

Diagnostics need the chain, not the step: reporting against user-written code
means walking parents outward to a `nil` parent, which one link does not reach
through nested expansion. So this is a deferred scope decision, not a research
problem.

What remains hard after the chain exists is **blame**, which provenance alone
does not settle — Racket carries source location and lexical context through
expansion and Typed Racket still has this problem. Three cases the chain cannot
separate: the caller passed something ill-typed (report at the use site); the
macro generates ill-typed code from its own literals (the use site is a
misleading target); nested expansion where the useful frame is neither outermost
nor innermost.

Proposed resolution: **macros used in typed positions declare input and output
type schemas.** A use-site mismatch is then caught before expansion and reported
where the user wrote it, and a type error in the expanded body is attributable
to the macro, whose declared output schema it violated. This converts an
unattributable error into one of two attributable ones.

## 5. Measurement update — E1 re-measured at the pinned target tuple

**This section supersedes E1's numbers and Nonclaims 1, 2, and 4.**

Target tuple now satisfied on both halves. Chez built from
`e95a7efbafa2cf3bd5343ea542e6bc909a7ab2c4` with all five submodules matching
`jolt-toolchains/config/toolchains.json` exactly (lz4 `ebb370ca`, nanopass
`bb47b569`, stex `afa60756`, zlib `da607da7`, zuo `a288cbfe`); Jolt at
jolt-bencode's pinned `89fe46e8a826b60b69d264fab76c864881055830`.

**The setup reproduces the recorded baseline.** Full decode measures
985,225 ns against `jolt-bencode/docs/PERFORMANCE.md`'s recorded 991,008 ns —
0.6%. E1 is therefore promoted from `monitored` indication to a measurement at
the target tuple.

A/B of `jolt@31cf9de0` (both perf commits) cherry-picked onto the pinned image:

| measurement | pinned baseline | + patch | change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| full bencode decode | 985,225 ns | 595,789 ns | **−40%** |
| `nth` on Window | 4,326 ns/byte | 2,061 | **−52%** |
| `decode-utf8`, 22-byte string | 98,389 ns | 56,931 | −42% |
| bare `octet` scan, 22 bytes | 80,886 ns | 37,863 | −53% |
| `reduce` over Window | 766 ns/byte | 640 | −16% |
| `nth` on persistent vector | 86 ns/byte | 86 | — |
| `aget` on byte-array | 95 ns/byte | 95 | — |

**Correctness validated, not merely neutral.** On the pinned image with the
patch applied: jolt-bytes `:status :verified`, 132,672 assertions (969 parents,
20,349 slices, 2,601 cursor reads, 4,845 compositions, 825 overlap cases);
jolt-bencode 13 tests, 109,209 assertions, 0 failures; Jolt unit gate 1127/1127.
The earlier jolt-bytes failure was purely version skew, as suspected.

**Jolt has already improved this path independently.** The same `nth` costs
4,326 ns/byte at `89fe46e8` and 1,336 at `380e59e` — a 3.2x gain from work
between those commits. The 25% figure recorded against `380e59e` understated
the patch because much of the win was already captured there; at the pin where
the recorded baseline lives, it is 40%.

**Superseded nonclaims.**

1. (was: absolutes are not evidence at any pinned tuple) — now measured at the
   tuple and reproducing the recorded baseline to 0.6%. Still a single
   non-isolated sample on one machine, and no cross-platform claim is made.
2. (was: `048582c3` is not claimed to fix E1) — the pair `048582c3`+`31cf9de0`
   is a 40% end-to-end reduction at the pin. It does **not** close the gap:
   `nth` on a deftype remains 2,061 ns/byte against 86 for a persistent vector,
   ~24x. Method resolution is no longer the dominant term; the remainder is the
   `jolt-nth` cond preamble and generic `jolt-invoke`, which needs call-site
   devirtualization for collection-interface methods in the backend — a
   compiler change, not attempted.
4. (was: jolt-bytes does not validate the patch) — it does, at the pin.

Nonclaim 3 stands unchanged and is reinforced: allocation was never the
dominant term, so modes remain unjustified by this measurement.

**Q1 status:** resolution (b) implemented — the flat table is cached in the
descriptor's own `ptable` under a reserved gensym key, no `chez-jrdesc-v3`
bump, no remint. A weak side table keyed by descriptor measured within noise
(836 vs 863 ns/byte at `380e59e`); the ptable form was kept for its structural
properties. Q1's remaining sub-question — whether closing the rest requires
backend devirtualization — is answered yes, and is now the open item.
